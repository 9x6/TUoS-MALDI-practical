# Metabolomics practical - data analysis

## Introduction

This practical originally would build on the hands-on metabolomics work scheduled as part of APS6625. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak this has become rather a lot less hands on. Nevertheless, we can still have a look at some of the data that was collected earlier to get a taste of how this data is structured and how a basic analysis can be performed using freely accessible tools.
